# cathedral-software-ui

This is a silly little Vue-and-CSS exercise I did while bored on Christmas Eve
waiting for the kids to go to sleep. The idea was to recreate one small piece
of the UI horror show of the movie The Net. A screen capture of the original
page is included, and if you've seen the movie, you know how to get to it. :)

That said, the movie and its UI designs were a product of their time. I was
beginning my web development career the same year (1995), and I can promise
the web sites I designed back then looked just as bad, if not worse (bevels,
tables, and imagemaps, oh my!). 

Caveats:
- The fonts Eurostile and Heiti SC are required for the full effect. They're on my Mac. YMMV.
- Only tested on Chrome for OS X
- I didn't do the background image. Open to PRs for a nice background SVG. :)

License: Public Domain. I claim no authorship of the original design in the
movie. This is a work of parody and critique of a *particular* movie's
particularly bad computer displays.
